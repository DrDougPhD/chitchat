# Coming soon...

The recent release of [the ONE simulator v1.6.0](https://akeranen.github.io/the-one/) has introduced some bugs in the ChitChat system.
It is currently under revision to successfully execute under multiple versions of the ONE simulator.
The code is also messy, and requires proper documentation. :)

# About this software

This is an implementation of the ChitChat router for DTNs / PSNs that can be integrated into the ONE simulator.
This implementation is what is described in McGeehan et. al. ChitChat: An Effective Message Delivery Method in Sparse Pocket-Switched Networks, ICDCS 2016.
